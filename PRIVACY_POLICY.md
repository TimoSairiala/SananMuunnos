We do not ask users, including children, to provide any personal information within the App.

**No Third-Party Data Sharing**

We do not share any information with third parties. Because we do not collect any information, there is nothing to share.

**Data Security**

Because we do not collect any data, there is no user data to secure. However, we take reasonable measures to ensure the security of our App itself.
